This is a layout file for LyX when working with `mla13.sty`.

Currently, all bibliography details need to be handled with LaTeX code as per the guidelines
found at [the repository for `mla13.sty`](https://github.com/jackson13info/mla13).

This layout file is based on the default `article.layout` file that comes with LyX.
